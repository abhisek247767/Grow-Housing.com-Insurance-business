Grow Housing Insurance business from INR 5Cr in Annualized premium collection to INR 50Cr in 12 months.

Background
Housing is a real-estate classified platform with 50M sessions in monthly traffic. With an aim to provide the best end-to-end experience, Housing EDGE was started in 2020. Currently, Housing EDGE has multiple services under its umbrella including Pay On Credit, Digital Rent Agreement, Homeloans etc.

We have a combined monthly traffic of 2M sessions coming on EDGE services, with the maximum engagement and repeat users on the Pay on Credit platform.

Just recently, we launched our first insurance product—Rent Protect Cover—which is an offering embedded in the Rent Payment flow*. This product helps rent paying users insure their rent payments in case of defined instances. We have seen amazing traction so far with the only insurance product.
